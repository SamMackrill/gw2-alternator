# gw2-alternator
(If anybody wants to help I would be delighted!)

Tool to help logging-in to multiple Guild Wars 2 alt accounts so as to harvest the daily rewards.

## Requires at least [.Net 6.0.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)


![Running](images/running.png)

## Features:
 * Import account details from GW2Launcher and/or GW2Launchbuddy
 * Automatically login to accounts with no user input
   * Will retry automatically on failure
 * Assist with collection of rewards every few days
 * Application has no access to your GW2 authentication details
 * Whilst you can still use your PC while this is running focus will constantly be stolen and this can be annoying

## Getting Started
 * On first launch you will see a security warning
   * Click "More info" then "Run Anyway"
![Running](images/warning1.png)
   * This is because it is too expensive to sign executables, sadge
 * On application launch you will be asked to confirm admin access
   * This is so symbolic links can be created (similar to GW2LaunchBuddy)
 * If you have no accounts defined then go to settings and import from GW2Launcher and/or GW2Launchbuddy
 * Hit Login to login to all the accounts
   * Only accounts not logged-in that day will launch (unless you click Force all or make a selection)
   * If you have > 20 accounts expect that some will fail (they will retry automatically)
   * The first character on the account will be automatically selected, this will be the one that logged in most recently
 * You can select accounts if you just want to launch a subset, this will ignore the date filtering
   * Use CTRL-click to unselect
 * To harvest it is best not to run the Login step that day as this may trigger ArenaNet's login throttling

 ## Working with Multiple Accounts
 * ArenaNet's anti-botting measures tend to make dealing with more than 10 accounts difficult
   * There is a hard limit of 40 accounts from a single IP address, resets every 8 hours
 * Use email aliases to set-up your accounts : https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308648?hl=en
 * Logging into many (>10? ) accounts on https://www.guildwars2.com/ may cause a lockout that takes 24 hours to clear
   * /!\ Something went wrong. Please try again in a few minutes
   * Speculation: This is linked to using email aliases
   * Using a VPN seems not to help here
 * Logging into the game will become slower after multiple (>10?) accounts and may block entirely
  * Using a VPN will help
  * Waiting a few minutes (5?) will help
  * GW2-Alternator tries to counter this by slowing down the login attempts after a failure
    * However the delay required depend on the past login history and is difficult to guess
    * There are tuning parameters in Settings to help adjust this

## Advanced
 * Settings, Account details, metrics and logs are found here: %AppData%\gw2-alternator

### GW2 API Key
 * Given a GW2 API key then Laurels and Mystic Coins will be counted (excludes unclaimed reward chests)
   * Account/Inventories/Characters/Wallet

### VPN
 * If you create manual VPN configurations in Windows then alternator can use these automatically
   * Ensure that the connection is a static IP or restricted to 255.255.255.0 subnet (for smooth GW2 authentication)

### Login Errors
 * Typical errors you may see (usually fixed by waiting 5 mins)

## TO DO
- [ ] Updates when the game version changes 
   * In the meantime use GW2Launcher or GW2Launchbuddy to do this
- [ ] More robust login delay
- [ ] Better GW2 State detection
   * e.g. when error occurs or when login is very slow
- [ ] Decouple Client from Account
- [ ] Improve Unit Testing
- [ ] Improve error reporting
- [ ] Investigate using GW2Launcher multiple Windows User accounts approach (this avoids Admin requirement)
- [ ] Improved numeric settings input and validation
